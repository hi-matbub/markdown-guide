## More about me

A Minimalist by nature, I spent my childhood riding bike's in the local fields and fishing with my dad.

I spent my early working career as a leader in the hospitality industry. I am thankful that I have been able to do what I love for _"work"_ these past 4 years. I look forward to many, many more.
